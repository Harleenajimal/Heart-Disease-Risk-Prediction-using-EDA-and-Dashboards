# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-using-EDA, ML-and- Power BI Dashboards
Can data predict a heart attack before it strikes? This project explores that question with the power of EDA and dashboards.

This project explores the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict heart disease risk using patient medical profiles. Using Python and Power BI, we analyzed health-related data and built an end-to-end workflow — from identifying risk indicators to training a predictive model and visualizing results.

1. Objectives
Explore and understand patterns in heart disease data through EDA

Identify key features such as chest pain type, ST depression, and max heart rate

Train and evaluate a classification model to predict heart disease presence

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for presenting insights and predictions

2. Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Power BI for dashboard development

MS Excel (for quick data views)

3. Machine Learning Pipeline
We implemented a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient has heart disease (binary classification):

Steps included:

Preprocessing: removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features

Splitting data into train and test sets (80/20)

Training a Logistic Regression classifier

Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Exporting predictions for use in the Power BI dashboard

4. Accuracy Achieved: ~85%
 Exported CSV file: heart_predictions.csv (used in Power BI for visual risk segmentation)

 Dashboard Highlights
Risk distribution by age group, gender, and chest pain type

Filters to dynamically explore health trends

Pie charts, bar graphs, and numeric cards to visualize key insights

Visual summary of predicted heart disease risk


5. Outcome
Built a robust EDA pipeline and translated results into a compelling dashboard.

Gained valuable experience in healthcare analytics, data storytelling, and real-world data handling.

Laid the groundwork for future predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

* Interesting Insight:

Asymptomatic chest pain — which shows no obvious symptoms — was the most common among patients with heart disease. Data reveals what symptoms alone often can't.

This project truly taught us how data can save lives when interpreted right.
