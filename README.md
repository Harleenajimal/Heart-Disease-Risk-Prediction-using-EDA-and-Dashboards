# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-using-EDA-and-Dashboards
Can data predict a heart attack before it strikes? This project explores that question with the power of EDA and dashboards.
This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboard visualization of a heart disease dataset to uncover critical health indicators related to cardiovascular risk.
✅ Objectives
To explore and understand the patterns in heart disease-related data.

To identify significant features like chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and ST depression that influence heart disease risk.

To create a Power BI dashboard that presents these insights in a clear, interactive, and stakeholder-friendly format.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI for dashboard creation

MS Excel for data review

📈 Key Highlights
Cleaned and preprocessed a real-world heart disease dataset.

Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate EDA.

Created visualizations including count plots, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Developed a Power BI dashboard to interactively analyze risk by gender, age, chest pain type, and more.

📊 Dashboard Insights
Patients with asymptomatic chest pain types showed the highest likelihood of heart disease.

Lower maximum heart rate and higher ST depression (oldpeak) were linked with increased heart disease risk.

The interactive dashboard allows filtering by features like age group and gender, enabling dynamic data exploration.

🎯 Outcome
Built a robust EDA pipeline and translated results into a compelling dashboard.

Gained valuable experience in healthcare analytics, data storytelling, and real-world data handling.

Laid the groundwork for future predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

💡 Interesting Insight:

Asymptomatic chest pain — which shows no obvious symptoms — was the most common among patients with heart disease. Data reveals what symptoms alone often can't.

This project truly taught us how data can save lives when interpreted right.
